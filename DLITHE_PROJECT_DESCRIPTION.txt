Project Title-Strong room security
Submitted by:Gagan P Poojary

Problem statement:
Build a strong room security system for a bank that accepts alphanumeric 'Key' password but will display only asterisks in the screen when password digits are entered. 
When access is denied with wrong passwords, red lights blink for the number of times the password is tried.
Upon 3 unsuccessful attempts, it raises long non-stop sound alarm together with continuous red light blinking which can only be stopped by entering a 'Master' password 
which is not same as the previous 'Key' password that is only known to the Managing Director of the bank. 
For correct 'Key' password and 'Master' password, the strong will be opened with a green light getting turned on as long as the door is open. 

Description:
The working is same as that of the problem statement.But an optional part was given in the statement which I am unable to simulate due to non availability of GPIO pin.I have used SG90 servo motor
to open the door on entering correct key/master password.Piezo buzzer is used to raise an alarm on three unsuccesful trials.On entering correct 'master' password door opens and after
10 seconds it closes automatically ,but using the same servo. 
The key password is :5858
The master password is:585D
Here I have assumed that the Managing Director of the bank makes no mistake while entering the Master password.
