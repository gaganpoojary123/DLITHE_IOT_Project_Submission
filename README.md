# 1)<Keypad.h>:
Keypad is a library for using matrix style keypads with the Arduino.
Authors of this library are :Mark Stanley,Alexander Brevig.You can download it using this link:https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad
# 2)<LiquidCrystal.h>
This library allows an Arduino/Genuino board to control LiquidCrystal displays (LCDs) based on the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset, which is found on most text-based LCDs. The library works with in either 4 or 8 bit mode (i.e. using 4 or 8 data lines in addition to the rs, enable, and, optionally, the rw control lines)
You can download it using this link: https://github.com/arduino-libraries/LiquidCrystal
# 3)<Servo.h>
This library can control a great number of servos.It makes careful use of timers: the library can control 12 servos using only 1 timer.<On the Arduino Due you can control up to 60 servos.You can download it using this link:https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo
